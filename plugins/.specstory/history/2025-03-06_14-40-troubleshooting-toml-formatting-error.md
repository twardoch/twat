I'll help you fix the TOML formatting error in your pyproject.toml file. The error message indicates there's an issue with a right bracket at line 377, column 57.

Let me examine the file to identify the specific problem.

After examining the file, I've found the issue. The error is at line 377, column 57, which is in the `[tool.pytest-benchmark]` section. The problem is with the formatting of the `compare` array.

Let me fix the TOML formatting error:

---

```diff
  [tool.pytest-benchmark]
  compare = [
-     'min',    # Minimum time
-     'max',    # Maximum time
-     'mean',   # Mean time
-     'stddev', # Standard deviation
-     'median', # Median time
-     'iqr',    # Inter-quartile range
-     'ops',    # Operations per second
-     'rounds', # Number of rounds
+     "min",    # Minimum time
+     "max",    # Maximum time
+     "mean",   # Mean time
+     "stddev", # Standard deviation
+     "median", # Median time
+     "iqr",    # Inter-quartile range
+     "ops",    # Operations per second
+     "rounds"  # Number of rounds
  ]
  histogram = true
  min_rounds = 100
  min_time = 0.1
  save-data = true
- storage = 'file'
+ storage = "file"
  
```

I've fixed the TOML formatting error in your pyproject.toml file. The issue was in the `[tool.pytest-benchmark]` section, specifically in the `compare` array. There were two main problems:

1. The last item in the array (`'rounds'`) had a trailing comma, which is not allowed in TOML syntax
2. The file was using single quotes (`'`) for strings, but TOML prefers double quotes (`"`)

The changes I made:

1. Removed the trailing comma after `'rounds'`
2. Changed all single quotes to double quotes in the benchmark section
3. Made sure the formatting is consistent

Now the file should pass the `toml-fmt` validation. The error message you received was indicating that the parser expected a right bracket (closing the array) but found an identifier (the comma) instead.

You can now run the `toml-fmt` command again, and it should work without errors.

No, it's still

Error: Error { inner: ErrorInner { kind: Wanted { expected: "a right bracket", found: "an identifier" }, line: Some(377), col: 57, at: Some(10623), message: "", key: [] } }
